# This script will download, unzip, prep, and merge ACLED's Version 5 historical data (1997-2014) and its realtime
# data. The downside is that it will need to be modified as the realtime data are updated, or if the url or filename for
# the historical data changes. The upside is that those changes only need to be made in the "File info" section that
# starts on line 21. Unless the basic structure of the files or their variable names change, the rest should keep working.

# Load required packages, which are only used in country-month aggregation stage

# Function to get zip file and extract csv using vector of two string objects and returning data frame

# Info on files to be ingested. To get this, I did the following on a Windows-driven PC:
# 1. Pointed my browser to http://www.acleddata.com/data/
# 2. Clicked on http://www.acleddata.com/data/version-5-data-1997-2014/ to get info on historical data
# 3. Right-clicked on the (csv) hyperlink for 'ACLED Version 5 (1997 â€“ 2014) standard file' and selected 'Copy link address'
# 4. Used Ctrl-V to paste that in between quotation marks in the past.url slot below.
# 5. Left-clicked on that same link to download the .zip file
# 6. Double-clicked on the downloaded .zip file to inspect the contents
# 7. Right-clicked on the .csv in the resulting window, selected 'Properties', and used Ctrl-C to copy the csv file's name
# 8. Used Ctrl-V to paste that file name in between quotation marks in the past.file slot below
# 9. Back on the ACLED site, clicked on 'Realtime Data (2015)'
# 10. Repeated steps 3 through 8 for 'Realtime 2015 All Africa File (updated 11th July 2015)(csv)' and the realtime.* slots below
